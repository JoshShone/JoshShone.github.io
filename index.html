            <p>Level designers understand what makes good gameplay. They design the game – but only a portion of it, normally referred to as a ‘level’.
                They take the specification defined by the gameplay designer, and get into the detail - the actions, events, objects and environment. 
                They also design the characters and the ways they behave. </p>

    <p>A good level designer will have a variety of skills that can place themselves on a multitude of different levels.<br>
