    <h1>Game Level Designers</h1>
    <h2>What is a Game Level Designer?</h2>
    <p>Level designers understand what makes good gameplay. They design the game – but only a portion of it, normally referred to as a ‘level’.
         They take the specification defined by the gameplay designer, and get into the detail - the actions, events, objects and environment. 
         They also design the characters and the ways they behave. </p>
    <p>A good level designer will have a variety of skills that can place themselves on a multitude of different levels.<br> 
        For example, one studio might ask for Experience creating levels with UE4 (White/Greyboxing levels in BSP).<br>
        Experience of Level Design process (2D concept to 3D level creation).<br>
        Gameplay passes (Area Collisions/Event Triggers/Out of bounds volumes etc).<br>
        Experience with enemy placement/spawning/navigation and behaviours.<br>
        Excellent communication skills to collaborate with a creative and multidisciplinary team.<br>
        Enjoys a creative challenge with the passion and motivation to make great games.<br>
        Experience using Unreal 4 Blueprints is a benefit.<br>
        Experience with Maya is a benefit.<br>
        Perforce / Hansoft skills is a benefit.</p>
